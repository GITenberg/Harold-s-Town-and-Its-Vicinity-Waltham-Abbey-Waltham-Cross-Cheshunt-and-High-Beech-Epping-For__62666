6</span>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> little book is intended for
the ordinary individual rather than the earnest student or the
ardent antiquary.&nbsp; As I have attempted to embellish the dry
bones of history and to present the undoubted beauties and charms
of the corner of England that lies upon the Herts and Essex
border in a manner likely to interest the former, my effort will
possibly appear to the latter to have several shortcomings.</p>
<p>That part of the book dealing with Cheshunt has presented some
difficulty.&nbsp; One day, perhaps, some industrious historian
will prepare a really good history of the ancient parish of
Cheshunt, and utilise to the best purpose the wealth of material
that lies hidden away in the parish chests.</p>
<p>To the Rev. J. H. Stamp, I am indebted for reading the proofs
and for some valuable information, as well as for his kind
permission to use the chronological data prepared by him.&nbsp;
To Mr. H. Collingwood Lee my thanks are also due for his kind
assistance.</p>

with the reverence due to natural beauty.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T gather such quantities of wild flowers and ferns

the roadside.&nbsp; By such gathering you injure the flora of the

to see flowers and ferns growing in their native haunts.</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T disturb the birds in their breeding season.</p>

9</span>HAROLD&rsquo;S TOWN AND ITS VICINITY.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">WALTHAM ABBEY, WALTHAM CROSS,<br />
CHESHUNT, AND HIGH BEECH, EPPING FOREST.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<h3><span class="GutSmall">CHAPTER I.</span><br />
WALTHAM ABBEY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Harold&rsquo;s Town</span>!&nbsp; We may
well speak of Waltham Holy Cross in this way, for the place
virtually owes its foundation to the last representative of the
Saxon dynasty, and abounds in associations with the brave, pious,
and wise prince whose lordship, like that of his great
predecessor, Alfred, had so great an influence for good upon the
social and political institutions of our England, and who so
nobly and bravely disputed the claim to the throne with the
Norman invader on the field of Senlac.&nbsp; We find a
contemporary estimate of Earl Harold&rsquo;s character in the
historic tract, <i>De Inventione Sanct&aelig; Crucis</i>, the
unknown author of which, who was, however, a Waltham man, says:
&ldquo;His was the truest heart and the wisest head and the
strongest and gentlest hand in the land.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
greatest historians of our own time have spoken in high,
appreciative terms of Harold&rsquo;s work and influence.&nbsp;
How considerable, then, is the interest to the traveller and
student alike of the place with which the life of Harold was so
intimately associated.</p>
<p>Though within just over half an hour&rsquo;s journey by rail
from the Metropolis, and but a crow flight of some <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>thirteen
miles therefrom, it would be pretty safe to say that not one per
cent. of the inhabitants of the great city have made any sort of
acquaintance with the beautiful old minster of Waltham, which
stands to-day for one of the finest examples of Norman
architecture, vying with Westminster Abbey in this respect,
whilst its history is, as old Thomas Fuller has observed,
&ldquo;the history of the Church of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; And if
this ancient pile represents so much architecturally and
ecclesiastically, it occupies no mean position among those
various influences that have gone to the making of English
history.</p>
<p>Hither came, for one purpose and another, many of the royal
heads of England, from Harold, the founder, to Charles II.;
dignitaries of the Church, and potent ornaments of the State;
while within the shadow of the minster&rsquo;s massy walls lived
and laboured men who have moulded and influenced the thoughts and
lives of the people.&nbsp; Henry I. and Matilda of Scotland were
visitors to the Abbey, the latter being a considerable
benefactress; Henry II. established the monastery here and richly
endowed it, he &ldquo;loved Waltham entirely, and lay many times
thereat.&rdquo;&nbsp; King John came often to Waltham; Henry III.
loved the Abbey for its beauty and seclusion, and resorted
thereto often for peace and retirement.&nbsp; Edward I. and his
beloved wife Eleanor were frequently in residence here, and when
the body of the latter was brought from Grantham to London in
1290, it rested for a night here, the mortal remains of the king
himself remaining in the Abbey, beside Harold&rsquo;s tomb, for
fifteen weeks, on their way from Scotland to Westminster in
1307.&nbsp; When Wat Tyler&rsquo;s insurrection placed Richard
II. in jeopardy he sought the sanctuary of the ancient
pile.&nbsp; Henry VIII., who was very fond of Waltham, had a
private lodging close by the Abbey, and was often the guest of
the abbot.&nbsp; Cranmer was frequently resident at Waltham; John
Foxe lived and wrote his &ldquo;Book of Martyrs&rdquo; here;
Thomas Tallis, father of our beautiful church music, was organist
at the Abbey; Thomas Fuller, author of the &ldquo;Worthies of
England,&rdquo; was incumbent of the <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Abbey Church; so also was Bishop
Joseph Hall, author of the &ldquo;Contemplations&rdquo;; Bishop
George Hall was a native of the town; and Izaak Walton, who so
loved the &ldquo;gentle Lea,&rdquo; was here often on a visit to
a relative.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The bustling train lands the visitor at Waltham Cross Station,
in the county of Herts, and one must proceed for about a mile on
foot eastward to attain the Abbey and town of Waltham Holy Cross,
which lie in the adjoining county of Essex.&nbsp; But after the
&ldquo;mean things that are new&rdquo; have been passed, the way
is pleasant.&nbsp; The road is bordered on one side for a goodly
distance by the marshlands and crosses many times over the river
Lea, which, as old Fuller humorously observes, &ldquo;not only
parteth Herts from Essex, but also seven times parteth from
itself, and is crossed by so many bridges.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beyond
the waterside inn on the bridge that spans the Lea navigation,
and displays the comforting sign of the &ldquo;Old English
Gentleman,&rdquo; Highbridge Street is entered, and the old town
opens out, with the tower of the Abbey, but just restored to its
original dignity of design, closing in the view.&nbsp; The
principal entrance to the Royal Gunpowder Factory lies just to
the left here, and much that is picturesque and quaint will
strike an observant eye on the way.&nbsp; The diversity in
character and style of the houses and shops, the irregularity of
their disposition, with their time-tinted exteriors, and the bits
of garden and splashes of verdant foliage, which break up the
line of bricks and mortar, timber and stucco, give the old street
that peculiar charm which is so often characteristic of an
ancient town.</p>
<h4>Romeland.</h4>
<p>Just before the Abbey is reached, approached by a way that
allows little more room than is needful for a cart to pass, is an
open square of very old houses, a most picturesque corner of the
old town, that bears the somewhat curious appellation of
Romeland. <a name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; How and why the place came <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>to be so
called it is not easy to determine; but the abbots of Waltham,
whose seat was at Copt Hall, had their London house on or
adjacent to a site in the parish of St. Mary-at-Hill, adjoining
what is now Billingsgate Market, which was also called
Romeland.&nbsp; To the rent of this, as well as the market square
at Waltham, the Pope laid claim, and the latter was then known as
Romescot or Peter&rsquo;s Piece.&nbsp; It is to this
circumstance, probably, that the place owes its name.</p>
<p>It was in the house of Master Cressy, a long-fronted
structure, which stands on the left of the entrance to Romeland,
that, in 1533, Cranmer, Fox, and Gardiner discussed the question
of Henry&rsquo;s divorce from Katherine of Aragon.&nbsp; Then it
was that Cranmer &ldquo;struck the keynote of the
Reformation,&rdquo; by claiming &ldquo;for the Word of God that
supremacy which had been usurped by the popes for
centuries.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fuller refers to this as a significant
circumstance and says: &ldquo;Thus did Waltham give Rome the
first deadly blow in England.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>A King&rsquo;s Diversions.</h4>
<p>Bluff King Hal was very partial to Waltham and enjoyed the
hunting in the forest.&nbsp; He frequently stayed at his house in
the Romeland, still standing at the north-east corner.&nbsp;
There are many stories, often with the &ldquo;merry
monarch&rdquo; for a hero, connected with his patronage of
Waltham.&nbsp; One day he left his hunting companions and
returned to Waltham in the guise of one of his attendants, and,
being invited to the abbot&rsquo;s table, ate heartily of the
sirloin of beef placed before him, to the great admiration of his
host.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well fare thy heart,&rdquo; the latter toasted
his guest, &ldquo;here is a cup of sack, and remember the grace
of thy master.&nbsp; I would willingly give one hundred crowns on
condition that I could feed as heartily on beef as thou
dost!&nbsp; Alas! my weak stomach will hardly digest the wing of
a small rabbit or chicken.&rdquo;&nbsp; The king pledged his
host, and thanked him; in due time he departed as secretly as he
had come.&nbsp; A little while after, the abbot was suddenly
arrested and conveyed to the Tower, where he was kept for some
days on bread and water.&nbsp; Then a sirloin of beef was set <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>before him,
of which he ate heartily.&nbsp; The king entered in the midst of
the meal, and demanded of his prisoner payment of the hundred
crowns, which, when the abbot recognised the trap into which he
had fallen, he gladly paid.</p>
<p>On another occasion, when Henry was the guest of Sir Henry
Colte, of Nether Hall, Roydon, the latter provided a novel
entertainment for his royal guest.&nbsp; It is related that the
knight and his men waylaid the monks on Waltham marsh one dark
night, having been informed by spies that they were on a visit to
Cheshunt nunnery, and, catching them in a buck stall (a trap used
for deer) left them wallowing in the mire until dawn.&nbsp; Then
the &ldquo;knight of merry conceits&rdquo; conducted his dejected
captives to the king, and presented them to his majesty as the
splendid game he had been able to secure.&nbsp; King Harry burst
into a loud fit of laughter, and declared that, though he had
&ldquo;often seen sweeter, he had never viewed fatter
venison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The open space (Romeland), with its quaint high-gabled,
stuccoed, and red-brick houses, is a busy scene on Tuesdays, when
the cattle market is held here.&nbsp; On the eastern side,
abutting upon the Abbey church, the tower of which comes
charmingly into view over the house tops, is the ancient corn
mill, which was given to the Abbey by Maud, Queen of Henry I., in
1108, in exchange for the site of Holy Trinity, Aldgate.&nbsp;
She also restored to the Abbey certain lands, which had been
alienated, known as the Abbey fields, which stretch northward
from here; and moreover established two fairs for the town.</p>
<p>Having so far diverged from the direct road to the Abbey, we
may well go a little further, taking a narrow roadway that runs
by the mill leading to the Abbey fields.</p>
<h4>The Abbey Gateway.</h4>
<p>At the termination of half a dozen or so of old houses and
cottages, there comes into view a bridge over the mill stream,
giving access to a beautiful arch, or rather pair of arches,
known as the Abbey Gateway.&nbsp; What remains of this once
important structure, which formed the <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>main entrance to the Abbey and the
abbot&rsquo;s house, consists of the front only of the old
gateway, and comprises two ancient pointed arches, with a tower
on the south side (the corresponding tower on the north has
disappeared).&nbsp; At the spring of the main arch, on either
side, are still traceable the arms of Edward III. on a shield
surmounted by an angel.&nbsp; The gateway was originally
approached by a drawbridge, and the porter&rsquo;s window in the
tower which commanded this still exists.&nbsp; The entrance to
the old monastic buildings was by a pointed doorway in the south
wall, which extends from the gate, now bricked up.&nbsp; This
handsome old gateway also formed the entrance to the mansion
erected by Sir Edward Denny, to whom the abbot&rsquo;s house was
given by Elizabeth.&nbsp; He was the grandson of Sir Anthony
Denny, Chamberlain to Henry VIII., to whom much of the
ecclesiastical property of Waltham was given after the
Dissolution.&nbsp; Sir Edward Denny&rsquo;s house, which was a
large one in the characteristic Elizabethan style (a central
doorway and two projecting wings), is spoken of by an old
chronicler as being &ldquo;beautiful to behold,&rdquo; with a
spacious garden of a character &ldquo;scarcely to be equalled by
any private gentleman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Higher up the Corn mill stream, in the Abbey fields, and
bordering on the &ldquo;pool,&rdquo; is another beautiful remnant
of very early architecture, probably contemporary with the Abbey
church, known as Harold&rsquo;s Bridge.&nbsp; Tradition says that
in early times this was the only passage across the stream, and
that not only Harold, but Tovi before him, used this bridge, when
proceeding into or from the royal forest of Waltham.&nbsp; It is
a most interesting architectural relic.&nbsp; There are still
visible two of the five beautiful ribs which originally adorned
this fine arch.&nbsp; Recently steps were taken to preserve this
interesting monument of antiquity by restoring the stonework
forming the base of the bridge.&nbsp; The Abbey farmhouse, with
its picturesque Elizabethan front, which is said to have formed
the abbot&rsquo;s stabling in medi&aelig;val times, stands to the
north-east of Harold&rsquo;s Bridge.</p>

<h4><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>The
Abbey Church.</h4>
<p>From the Abbey fields, the finest view of Harold&rsquo;s noble
minster is obtained, and it is with feelings of pleasant
anticipation that one retraces one&rsquo;s steps thereto,
meditating on the way upon the many strange and wondrous scenes
that have been witnessed on the ground over which one
passes.&nbsp; As the eye wanders over the beautiful lines and the
massive, age-stained walls of the ancient church, the mind is
impressed with its grandeur and its significance as a vast page
of England&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>The Abbey church and town of Waltham Holy Cross alike owe
their actual foundation to Tovi the Proud, standard-bearer and
chief counsellor to Cnut, who, delighted by the fine
opportunities for hunting which were afforded by the number of
deer running in the great forest of Waltham, established a
settlement here, and founded a convent.&nbsp; Hither, also, Tovi
brought from his manor of Lutegarsbury (Montacute), in Somerset,
a miraculous crucifix, and set it up in the church.&nbsp; The
legend of this Holy Cross, as told in the <i>De Inventione</i>
tract, and translated by Lambarde, is a wonderfully interesting
story.</p>
<h4>The Legend of the Holy Cross.</h4>
<p>It runs as follows: <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a> &ldquo;In the tyme
that Kinge Cnut reigned in Ingland theare lyved at a Place of the
called comonly Lutegarsbyry, in French Montague, a simple man by
occupation a carpenter and by Office Sexton of his parishe, to
whom on a Night appeared a Vision of Christe Crucified
commaundinge him that as sone as Day brake he should goe to the
parishe priest and with him accompanied by his parishioners in
solemne processione to go up to the Toppe of the Hyll adjoyninge
and to digge wheare (if they would beforehand make theimselves by
Confession, Fastinge, and Praier worthy of suche a Revelacion)
they should finde a Crosse, the very sign of Christes
passion.&nbsp; This plaine Man, supposinge <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>it a
fantastical Dreame, tooke at first no great Head thereof, save
that, he imparted it with his Wife who also thought it but an
Illusion.&nbsp; Wherefore the Image appeared againe, and so
griped him by the Hande that the Dynt of the Nayles remayned in
his Hand to be sene the Daye followinge.&nbsp; Being thus pricked
forwarde on he goeth to the Priest and discloseth the hole
matter.&nbsp; He arrayeth his Parishe, displayeth his Banners,
putteth on Copes and Surplas, and setteth the Carpenter foremost
as his Captaine, they digge awhile and anone they find a great
Marble havinge in it of black Flynt the Image of the Crucifixe so
artificially wroughte as if God himselfe (sayth myne Auteur) had
framed it.&nbsp; Under the right Arme of this Crucifixe thear was
a small Image of the same Forme, a litle Belle also, and a black
Booke conteyninge the Text of the four Evangelists.&nbsp; All
this they signified to Tovi le Prude then Lord of the Soyle,
Standarde Bearer to the Kinge and his Chief Councelor, who came
to the place in great Hast and by the advice of his Gents lefte
the smalle cross in the Churche theare determyninge to bestow the

At the Lengthe he remembered a small House that he had begone to

<p>The cross gave its name to the place, and over a long series
of years attracted crowds of the devote, the maimed, and diseased
to the place.&nbsp; In 1192 the cross was covered with silver,
but the figure of Christ was left untouched by reason, it is
surmised, of a remarkable incident that had happened a few years
previously.&nbsp; On that occasion, the crucifix being under
repair, Robert the Goldsmith, of St. Albans, removed the circlet
round the thigh, when all present were stricken blind for a
considerable time.</p>
<h4>Harold&rsquo;s Minster.</h4>
<p>On the site of Tovi&rsquo;s foundation Earl Harold, upon whom
Waltham and vast lands had been bestowed by Edward the Confessor,
reared and endowed a magnificent church, which he intended to
rival in beauty and importance King Edward&rsquo;s abbey church
at Westminster.&nbsp; The dean and twelve secular Black canons
who formed the ecclesiastical constitution of Harold&rsquo;s
foundation, were amply provided for, each of the latter having a
manor and the dean six manors for his maintenance.&nbsp; In later
times (1177) Henry II., on the ground that the canons had grown
wasteful and corrupt, substituted for Harold&rsquo;s foundation
an Augustinian priory, then, seven years later, raised this to
the dignity of an Abbey, installing Walter de Gaunt, of Oseney,
as the first abbot.</p>
<p>Harold&rsquo;s church was splendidly adorned, in a manner <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>that
suggests, as the late Bishop Stubbs observes, that the founder
had been influenced by Eastern art.&nbsp; Brazen plates, gilt,
were spread over the walls, the capitals and bases of the massive
pillars were curiously carved and wreathed with the gilded metal;
the altar was enriched with elaborate ornaments, the furniture,
reliquaries, and vestments were provided on a liberal
scale.&nbsp; Numerous relics, in addition to the miraculous
crucifix, formed part of the endowment.&nbsp; The consecration of
the church probably took place on May 3, 1060, the Feast of the
Invention of the Holy Cross, which became one of the fair days
under the charter of Matilda.&nbsp; Kinsinge, Archbishop of York,
performed the ceremony of consecration, assisted by most of the
English bishops.&nbsp; King Edward and his queen Edith, sister of
Harold, and the flower of the nobility, were present.</p>
<p>It was here that, scarce six years later, Harold, on his
return from Stamford Bridge, had news of the Norman
invasion.&nbsp; He stayed for the night at his mansion in the
park at Nazeing, still called Harold&rsquo;s Park, and on the
morrow offered up prayers for his success in the Abbey.&nbsp; It
is recorded that the figure of the Saviour on the wondrous
crucifix bowed the head as if to express sorrow for his
inevitable fate.&nbsp; He set out for Senlac accompanied by two
of the canons, who, if the omen were fulfilled, were bidden to
bring back with them the body of the founder.&nbsp;
Harold&rsquo;s war-cry was &ldquo;Holy Rood.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
canons, true to their trust, recovered the king&rsquo;s body, by
the aid of Harold&rsquo;s old love, Editha the
&ldquo;Swan-necked,&rdquo; and brought it to Waltham with all
possible honours.&nbsp; Here the remains were interred, being
translated from time to time as alterations and additions to the
church necessitated (it was not finally completed until 1125),
finding a final resting place near the great altar, about 140
feet from the present east end of the church.&nbsp; Here a most
beautiful and imposing tomb was erected, but all that remains of
this is a curious piece of carved ironstone representing the face
of a warrior, which, after many vicissitudes, including its use
as a fountain ornament, was returned to the possession of the
church a few years ago, <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>and now reposes on the tomb of Robert
Smith in the chancel.</p>
<p>To the antiquary, the student, and the lover of all that is
beautiful in architecture, the ancient minster offers a boundless
store of interest.&nbsp; In the course of his scholarly
observations upon the architecture and history of the abbey
church the late Professor Freeman says: &ldquo;Barbarous
mutilations and hardly less barbarous additions have entirely
destroyed its character, as seen from without, and even within,
both medi&aelig;val alterations of the strangest kind and the
accumulated enormities of more recent days have gone far to ruin
the general effect of the original building.&nbsp; Still a large
portion of the original interior remains untouched; an interior
deserving attentive study as one of the noblest specimens of
Northern Romanesque, and invested with a yet higher interest if
we may regard it as called into being by the taste and bounty of
the last of our native kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The noble edifice was cruciform in plan, with a nave and
aisles (all that now remain), choir, and central tower.&nbsp; The
spring of one of the great arches upon which this latter stood,
is plainly visible at the present east end.&nbsp; This tower fell
in 1552, doubtless owing to the destruction of the choir, and the
present western tower was erected about five years later out of
the fragments.&nbsp; The nave consists of seven bays, and is 109
feet long from east to west, by 55 feet wide, and from the floor
to the beautifully painted ceiling, the work of Sir E. J.
Poynter, is a height of 52 feet.&nbsp; Upon the great pillars
that support the arches will be noticed the spiral and chevron
indenting, originally filled with chased and gilt metal.&nbsp; In
some places the rivet holes are still discernible.&nbsp; The
aisles were originally vaulted, and the triforium passage above
was lighted by the circular windows that will be noticed.&nbsp;
There are three tiers of arches: the nave or arcade, the
triforium, and the clerestory.&nbsp; The Rev. J. H. Stamp, in his
excellent little history of Waltham, says of the plan and design
of the church that whilst the cruciform plan was significant of
Christ crucified, the twelve pillars <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>represented the apostles, and the
three tiers of arches the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The wonderful grandeur and nobility of the interior can well
be appreciated by standing just within the tower and viewing the
&ldquo;long-drawn aisles&rdquo; through the great western
arch.&nbsp; This arch formed part of the scheme of restoration
and rebuilding which took place at the latter end of the
thirteenth century, when the original Norman doorway was removed
and a grand Decorated west front substituted.&nbsp; This had two
turrets on each side, terminating in octagonal pinnacles of fine
proportions and design, and a beautiful Decorated window appears
to have been inserted over the arch.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the
present tower obscures much of this thirteenth century
work.&nbsp; With this scheme of rebuilding, which was instigated
by Abbot Reginald and carried out by his successors, Abbots Hugh
and Robert, is associated a curious and unfortunate defacement or
destruction of a portion of the beautiful Norman arcading.&nbsp;
There will be noticed on either side of the church, near the west
end, a high Gothic arch, sadly out of harmony with the remaining
arcading.&nbsp; It is said that the architect who was first
engaged upon the restoration work was demented, and set about
transforming the architectural character of the church.&nbsp; He
removed the elegant filling-in of the triforium and cut away the
lower Norman arches, and after having thus mutilated two tiers of
arches on each side, began upon the third tier on the north side,
but was happily stopped in his crazy efforts by the interference
of the abbot, and his peremptory dismissal.&nbsp; It is to his
successor that we owe the beautiful western doorway and
front.&nbsp; This restoration scheme also included the adornment
of the interior with beautiful frescoes, signs of which are still
slightly visible on one or two of the arches.</p>
<h4>Relics and Monuments.</h4>
<p>Within the tower of the church are preserved the old stocks
and whipping-post, together with the pillory, which formerly
stood on the site now occupied by the new municipal
buildings.&nbsp; In the vestry are also preserved a number <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>of
interesting relics, including a pilgrim&rsquo;s bottle and the
massive blade of a battle-axe which, tradition avers, was
Harold&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There are many monuments and numerous interesting tablets and
memorials.</p>
<p>Of the monuments the most noticeable is the tomb of Sir Edward
Denny and his wife Margaret, in the chancel.&nbsp; The knight is
represented in armour lying on his left side, the figure of his
wife reclining below; their ten children are carved in relief, in
attitudes of prayer, upon the panel beneath.&nbsp; This Edward
Denny was the comrade of Spenser, the poet, and Sir Philip
Sidney, and the captor of the rebel Earl of Desmond.</p>
<p>Near by stands the effigy of Lady Elizabeth Greville, first
cousin to Lady Jane Grey, widow of Henry Denny (son of Sir
Anthony Denny) and wife of Sir Edward Greville, third son of the
ancestor of the present Earl of Warwick.&nbsp; This effigy is all
that remains of an elegant tomb of alabaster, which formerly
stood to the north of the altar.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the chancel, near the organ, stands
the marble tomb of Robert Smith, a wealthy seaman of the
seventeenth century.&nbsp; The magnificent choir which was so
ruthlessly demolished by Henry VIII. at the Dissolution
contained, in addition to the tomb of the founder, the handsome
sarcophagi of Baron Hugh Nevil, Lord High Justice of England,
temp. Richard I.; Archdeacon Passelew, and numerous abbots,
earls, and knights.</p>
<p>There are three mural brasses on the south wall, one being to
the memory of Edward Stacey, one of the lay pensioners of the
monastery at the time of the Dissolution, and another to Thomas
Colte, second son of Sir John Colte, of Nether Hall, Roydon.</p>
<p>The remains of the old choir screen, a beautiful example of
carpentry and carving; the ancient Purbeck marble font; the
handsome reredos, and the fine rose window above; the marks of
the chain that once held the great Bible, on one of the pillars,
and many other features are here to interest the visitor.&nbsp;
The handsome <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>stained glass in the Rose window, depicting the
Creation, and the three lights under the arch were designed by
the late Sir Edward Burne-Jones.</p>
<p>Nor must the beautiful Lady Chapel (the only chapel remaining
of five that were originally attached to the church) be
forgotten.&nbsp; This dates its foundation from 1316, and is by
some regarded as one of the richest specimens of medi&aelig;val
architecture in England.&nbsp; Its window tracery is certainly
very elegant, though this has undergone considerable
restoration.&nbsp; The interior was originally adorned with
statuary and frescoes, a painting of the Last Judgment occupying
the east wall.&nbsp; Traces of this ancient and curious
representation are still discernible.&nbsp; The remains of the
old piscina are also still in existence.&nbsp; Of the crypt
beneath, Thomas Fuller, who, by the way, was for many years
incumbent here, quaintly speaks as being &ldquo;the finest that I
ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>The greatness of the Abbey.</h4>
<p>Having feasted the eye and the mind on the many beautiful and
interesting features of the ancient fane, one may rest beneath
the aged elm tree in the churchyard, and meditate upon the
circumstance that this magnificent edifice is but a third portion
of Harold&rsquo;s minster, and that only a fragment of the old
monastery which grew up around it in medi&aelig;val times,
forming a vast congregation of stately buildings, now remains;
that just as the physical characteristics of the Abbey and its
minster were vast and important, so were its landed possessions,
which stretched out far and wide on all sides; that the immensity
of its wealth was such that at the time of the Dissolution the
gross revenue amounted to &pound;1,079 12s. 1d., representing
about &pound;15,000 at the present day; whilst the potency of the
abbots, who were mitred and sat in Parliament, was great, and the
splendour of their respective establishments was upon a generous
scale.&nbsp; Some of these abbots, of whom there were thirty in
all, were great in the best sense of the word, and exercised
their potency for the good of the Abbey and the community towards
which they stood in the joint relation of spiritual and <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>temporal
overlords.</p>
<h4>A Feudal Abbot.</h4>
<p>One of these particularly was a man of vigorous character and
determined spirit, who, &ldquo;in asserting the rights and
privileges of the monastery during his rule, came into collision
with parishioners, neighbours, pope, and king.&rdquo;&nbsp;
First, differences appear to have arisen between the parishioners
and the abbot as to the former having right of access to the
central tower and bells, which they had enjoyed under
Harold&rsquo;s foundation.&nbsp; The abbot accordingly shut out
the people from this and the choir (the monastic part of the
church) by erecting a stone screen or wall immediately behind the
altar of the parish church (the present nave).&nbsp; This wall is
clearly observable from the outside beneath the Rose window at
the east end, and in this will be seen traces of two doorways
with which it was pierced to allow the dean or parish priest to
enter and minister to the people.&nbsp; There would seem to have
been reprisals on the part of the parishioners, for a little
later they disputed the abbot&rsquo;s rights of grazing on the
marsh, and, resorting to violence, severely assaulted the keepers
and killed the abbot&rsquo;s horses.&nbsp; For this the offenders
suffered the double penalty of being heavily fined by the
justices of the King&rsquo;s Bench and excommunicated by the
abbot.&nbsp; The latter, however, did not enforce either, and
forgave the erring ones.&nbsp; Next Abbot Simon was at war with
the lord of the manor of Cheshunt, Peter, Duke of Savoy, who
claimed all the land west of the main stream of the
Lea&mdash;called the King&rsquo;s stream&mdash;whilst the abbot
contended that his jurisdiction extended to the smaller stream
half a mile further west.&nbsp; The lawsuit which ensued was, as
old Fuller says, &ldquo;as long lived as any in England,&rdquo;
by reason of &ldquo;the greatness of the clients&rdquo;; but it
was finally concluded in favour of the abbot.&nbsp; This occurred
in 1248, and three years later the doughty abbot was setting the
pope at defiance by protesting against the persecution,
oppression, and robbery of the conventual churches by the bishops
and legates.&nbsp; Twice also Abbot Simon successfully resisted
the extortionate demands of the king, and stubbornly <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>refused to
enrich the royal treasury at the expense of the monastery.</p>
<p>I am afraid I have rather digressed from the main purpose of
this little work in relating some of the deeds of this sturdy
abbot, but I think the brief relation of these may be of some
interest as an illustration of the social and religious
conditions of Waltham in medi&aelig;val times and of the
wonderful power wielded by these old ecclesiastical
potentates.</p>
<h4>A Conventual Relic.</h4>
<p>Now to resume the broken thread.&nbsp; The remaining fragment
of the conventual buildings to which I have alluded above
consists of a beautiful little chamber, often spoken of as
&ldquo;an architectural gem,&rdquo; which stands in the Abbey
gardens.&nbsp; It is locally known by the undignified appellation
of the &ldquo;potato cellar,&rdquo; due to its irreverent use in
modern times.&nbsp; It consists of a small longitudinal
apartment, with a beautifully groined ceiling and quadripartite
vaulting.&nbsp; It is 29 feet long, running north and south, and
has two doorways, one of which is blocked up.&nbsp; It is
considered to have been either the fratry or an antechamber to
the abbot&rsquo;s mansion, in which the monks assembled
preparatory to the procession to the church.</p>
<p>One passes from the churchyard to the
market-place&mdash;another interesting corner of the old
town&mdash;by an ancient lych-gate, adjacent to the Harp Inn,
which is peculiarly interesting as being probably the oldest
existing relic of domestic architecture directly connected with
the Abbey, and has from very early times formed the main entrance
to the church.</p>
<p>Turning sharp to the left, into Sun Street, one is soon in the
old main road that runs from London, by Walthamstow, Chingford,
and Sewardstone, to Nazeing, Roydon, etc.&nbsp; To the left,
round by the New Inn, the fine old wall of the Abbey gardens
comes into view, and midway along its extent will be noticed the
sign of the cross and a lozenge (probably a sign indicative of
the Trinity) inserted in black brick.&nbsp; The remains of the
moat, which, with the mill stream, completely surrounded the
Abbey, will also be seen.</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Retracing our steps towards London, a few yards beyond
the entry of Sun Street, will be noticed an old house jutting
upon the street, with stucco and &ldquo;roughcast&rdquo;
exterior, the entrance to which is by a gate in the adjoining
garden wall.&nbsp; This was the home of John Foxe, the
martyrologist, and here he wrote the famous &ldquo;Book of
Martyrs.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is said that Cranmer also occupied this
house when resident in Waltham.&nbsp; Its interior presents many
interesting features.&nbsp; In the garden is a tulip tree, which
is probably a descendant of <a name="page30"></a><span

A RAMBLE TO EPPING FOREST AND HIGH BEECH.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Foxe&rsquo;s house it is a
pleasant walk to Epping Forest and High Beech.&nbsp; The way is
by Farm Hill (almost opposite Foxe&rsquo;s house) to Brookside,
thence sharp to the right over the bridge, and up the hill by the
old windmill for a little more than half a mile, to the hamlet
known as Honey lane, where the margin of the fine old forest, the
heights of which will have been viewed on the way, opens
out.&nbsp; We turn up by the covered well and trough into Honey
lane itself.&nbsp; Those who may prefer to ensure a right
direction may keep to the roadway, which strikes up the hill
through the forest, and, bearing sharp to the left and right
respectively, leads direct to High Beech.&nbsp; It is more
pleasant, perhaps, to wander through the woodland, and such as
would prefer to do this may strike across the plain to the left
of the bridge over the stream, following the line of the
watercourse, then, taking a break in the thicket that will be
found, a clear way called the Verderer&rsquo;s Path will soon be
entered.&nbsp; Pursuing this to the right (south), we come out at
the top of the hill in Honey lane, near a cyclists&rsquo; caution
board, and the way to High Beech, the spire of the church being
clearly noticeable, is then straight along the road.&nbsp; Many a
charming peep over the Lea Valley will have been enjoyed on the
way, but from High Beech Plain a panorama of superb beauty is
opened out to view.&nbsp; Those who have hitherto regarded the
home counties of Essex, Middlesex, and Herts as poor, flat, and
featureless parts of our England will be agreeably surprised at
the rich beauty of the landscape which this view of the <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Lea Valley
affords.</p>
<h4>Tennyson&rsquo;s home.</h4>
<p>It was a scene that the late Lord Tennyson, who resided for
some years at Beech Hill Park here, which lies a little to the
west of the King&rsquo;s Oak Inn, loved and admired, as he also
reverenced the ancient town and minster of Waltham.&nbsp; It was
the sonorous bells of Harold&rsquo;s church that inspired the
beautiful lines of &ldquo;In Memoriam&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Ring out, wild
bells, to the wild sky.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His noble drama of &ldquo;Harold,&rdquo; too, doubtless owes
its inception to the poet&rsquo;s residence in and intimate
connection with this locality.&nbsp; High Beech church lies a
little beyond the King&rsquo;s Oak Inn and the plain; it is a
modern building in the Gothic style.</p>
<p>From the church we retrace our steps to the inn named, and
make the historic earthworks known as Ambresbury Banks or Camp (a
bee line of about two miles) our next objective.&nbsp; The road
continues beyond the junction with Honey lane, whence we came,
then bears to the right on to the Wake Arms Inn and the main
Epping road, a little less than a mile along which brings us to
the camp, this lying on the east side of the road.&nbsp; But
there is a very pleasant way thither through the heart of the
forest, which I will endeavour to describe.&nbsp; Here, however,
I would suggest that all who wish to enjoy the real beauty of the
forest in this way should take the precaution to carry a reliable
compass, for it is very easy to become confused about the
geographical circumstances of one&rsquo;s surroundings among the
wood and thicket.</p>
<p>We turn off across the open plain to the right, about 300
yards beyond the King&rsquo;s Oak Inn, where will be found a
track or walk, which at times is rather indistinct.&nbsp; Follow
this for about half a mile, then turn sharp to the right (east)
through the glade into the valley, skirting the swamp and Wake
Valley ponds (leaving these to the north) on to the main
road.&nbsp; Here we turn to the left and continue to the Wake
Arms Inn.&nbsp; Thence the Theydon road (opposite) is taken, down
Jack&rsquo;s Hill for about half a mile, and when the <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>Verderers&rsquo; Ride is noticed on the left, this is
followed to Ambresbury Banks.&nbsp; This route will take the
wanderer through parts of the forest that are almost
unfrequented, where oak and beech and hornbeam flourish in all
their wild grandeur; where many of the fungi and lichens, for
which the forest is so noted, will be met with, as well as many
beautiful flowering plants, rare-winged insects, and most of the
birds, so large and representative a number of which make their
home in the forest.&nbsp; Nor is it at all unlikely that a herd
of the forest deer will be seen, for these graceful creatures
generally resort to this part.&nbsp; Upon the walk one&rsquo;s
mind almost naturally reverts to the days when this 5,000 odd
acres of woodland, now the &ldquo;people&rsquo;s
playground,&rdquo; was a mere morsel of the great forest of
Waltham, an almost boundless tract of wild forest land, which
formed the favourite hunting ground for the Saxon, Norman,
Plantagenet, and Tudor kings.</p>
<p>Of Ambresbury Camp, which we have now attained, much has been
said and written in dispute as to its origin.&nbsp; There,
however, seems to be little doubt that it formed an important
British earthwork, and, despite all that has been said to the
contrary, it is extremely probable that it formed the final
stronghold of Boadicea, Queen of the Iceni, from which she and
her vast army of Britons issued forth to do battle with the Roman
legions under Suetonius Paulinus, and suffered that terrible
defeat of which history tells us.&nbsp; This is a spot,
therefore, that awakens solemn thoughts.</p>
<h4>Copt Hall and Upshire.</h4>
<p>The road back to Waltham turns out of the Epping highway
directly opposite the camp, and takes us by the main entrance and
lodges of Copt Hall, once the stately seat of the abbots of
Waltham, who frequently entertained royal heads, potent princes,
and great nobles here.&nbsp; Robert Fuller, the last abbot,
surrendered the beautiful mansion and domain to Henry VIII. at
the Dissolution.&nbsp; In later times Copt Hall was the residence
of the Princess Mary, subsequently the seat of the Earl of
Middlesex, patron of old Thomas Fuller, and is now held by the
Wythes family.&nbsp; Half a mile further on we enter <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the pretty
hamlet of Upshire, with its broad expanse of green and pretty
little church, built a year or two ago by Sir T. Fowell Buxton,
Bart., lord of the manor, whose fine domain of Warlies stretches
far away over the undulating country to the north.&nbsp; The
entrance to Warlies is passed at the bottom of the hill.&nbsp;
Thence the way is by a pleasant country road, running through
fields and pastures, with here and there a farm-house or a group
of cottages, to Waltham Abbey again.</p>

class="GutSmall">CHAPTER III.</span><br />
WALTHAM CROSS AND THEOBALDS</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Waltham Cross</span>, which is not to be
confounded with Waltham Holy Cross, commonly called Waltham
Abbey, for whilst the latter is in Essex, the former is in
Hertfordshire, and forms part of the parish of Cheshunt.&nbsp; To
reach Waltham Cross, the visitor must retrace his steps towards
the railway, and passing over this, the historic monument, which
stands at the junction with the old Great North Road&mdash;is
reached by a walk of five minutes&rsquo; duration.</p>
<p>Waltham Cross was one of the several similar monuments erected
to the memory of Queen Eleanor by her devoted husband, Edward
I.&nbsp; She died at Herdby, near Grantham, on November 12, 1290,
whence her remains were conveyed to Westminster for interment by
stages which were marked by ten crosses.&nbsp; Of these only the
crosses at Geddington, Northampton, and Waltham remain.</p>
<p>Waltham Cross has long been admired as an elegant specimen of
Early English or Middle Pointed architecture.&nbsp; It is
hexagonal in form, and consists of three handsome stages or
storeys, each terminated by an embattled frieze, whilst the
angles are respectively supported by a graduated buttress,
ornamented with foliated finials.&nbsp; Within the panels of the
lower storey are shields bearing the arms of England, Castile,
and Leon and Poictou; whilst statues of Queen Eleanor occupy
niches on the second storey.</p>
<h4>The Four Swans Inn.</h4>
<p>Each corner of the road that here debouches upon the main high
road is occupied by an inn, that nearer London being the Falcon,
and the other the Four Swans.&nbsp; Both are survivals of that
period of prosperity when the coaches between <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>London and
Cambridge sped along the road.&nbsp; Whilst, however, the Falcon
has been rebuilt in recent times&mdash;a work which made possible
the widening of the roadway and the preservation of the
Cross&mdash;the Four Swans retains very much of its old-time
glory, and its sign is still stretched across the main street,
forming an advertisement of such a conspicuous character as would
not be admissible now-a-days.&nbsp; The interior of this inn
possesses many of those interesting features which are generally
attached to old coaching and posting houses, and in its oldest
portion is a handsome Jacobean staircase.&nbsp; Its foundation,
however, <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>dates far beyond even coaching days, for the house
originally formed part of the possessions of the Abbey, of which
it was a guest house, whilst the Abbot&rsquo;s manorial court was
held here.&nbsp; The oldest part of the house is that to the left
of the gateway on entering, and it is highly probable that the
suite of rooms in which the tenants assembled&mdash;described by
Dr. Stukeley in 1752 as being &ldquo;where the chimneys
are&rdquo;&mdash;were contained in this wing, whilst the older
portion of the spacious apartment over the gateway, now used as a
masonic hall, formed the abbot&rsquo;s court-room.&nbsp; At other
times the place was used for the lodgement of pilgrims and
similar purposes.&nbsp; The sign of the Four Swans, the only one
that I have met with, is derived from the arms of Earl Harold,
whose shield had emblazoned upon it a cross with four swans.</p>

<h4>Theobalds.</h4>
<p>With the Abbey, the Cross, and the Four Swans Inn we leave
behind us, it may be said, associations with and monuments of
medi&aelig;val times, and enter upon the later, but no less
stirring epoch of English history which is marked by the Tudor,
Jacobean, and Commonwealth periods, by a visit to the historic
seat of Theobalds, or Tibbles, as it is locally called.&nbsp; The
entrance to the park is from the high road, close to Theobalds
Grove Station on the Great Eastern Railway branch line to
Cheshunt.&nbsp; As one saunters through the long leafy aisle,
there comes to mind the reference to this famous seat and its
locality in old Izaak Walton&rsquo;s famous classic, the
&ldquo;Complete Angler,&rdquo; wherein the angler, the hunter,
and the falconer, each commends his recreation; Piscator avows
his intention of going &ldquo;this fine, fresh May
morning,&rdquo; as far as Ware, whereupon Venator says his
purpose is to &ldquo;drink my morning draught at the Thatched
House, Hoddesdon,&rdquo; and Anceps rejoins: &ldquo;Sir, I shall,
by your favour, bear you company as far as Theobalds, and there
leave you; for then I turn up to a friend&rsquo;s house, who mews
a hawk for me, which I now long to see.&rdquo;&nbsp; The present
house of Theobalds, which is the seat of Lady Meux, is modern,
having <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>been erected in 1768, and, though large, is not
beautiful.&nbsp; A view of the house and gardens can be obtained
by taking the footpath on the left, running along the bank of the
New River, the stream being widened into a lake here, and
creating a very pretty feature of the Park lands.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image39" href="images/p39b.jpg">

"Temple Bar.  In its new home, at the main entrance to Theobalds
Park"
 src="images/p39s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The main entrance to the house is by the famous Temple Bar,
which stands a little further along the drive from which the path
has been taken.&nbsp; A more beautiful setting for Wren&rsquo;s
wonderful gateway it would scarcely be possible to conceive or
create, and I know not another gateway entrance to a private park
or domain throughout the country that is more beautiful than
this.&nbsp; The nobility of its lines, the grandeur of the
design, and the beauty of the stone are here all thrown into
wonderful relief by the rich green of the foliage which forms the
setting of the gate.&nbsp; One cannot help wondering what Dr.
Johnson, or Sir Joshua Reynolds, or Charles Lamb, to all of whom
the old gate that marked the western boundary of the city was
familiar, would have said if they could have seen it transported
to its present position.&nbsp; They were all ardent lovers of the
town, and would certainly have lamented its loss from their Fleet
Street.&nbsp; The Doctor would probably have said, &ldquo;Sir! it
is a vile outrage upon the City of London.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet I
think their artistic perceptions would have compelled them to
admit that its new home endowed it with a grandeur that it never
before possessed.</p>
<p>Theobalds and its immediate vicinity is very rich in historic
incidents.&nbsp; With it are associated the lives and deeds of
Cardinal Wolsey, the great Lord Burleigh, Queen Elizabeth, James
I., Charles I., the Cromwells, and others.</p>
<p>Theobalds formed one of the six manors into which was
parcelled the parish of Cheshunt, which itself at the time of the
Conquest formed a manor in the Honour of Richmond, conferred upon
Earl Alan by his uncle, William the Conqueror.&nbsp; The origin
of the name is unknown, but in 1441 we find the manor of
Theobalds was granted by the Crown to the hospital of St. <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Anthony, in
London.&nbsp; About the middle of the sixteenth century it was
conferred upon William Cecil, afterwards Lord Burleigh, Secretary
of State to Edward VI. and Elizabeth.&nbsp; In July, 1564, the
queen paid her trusty counsellor a visit here, and was so pleased
with her reception and the beauty of the place, that she
expressed her intention of returning hither at a future
date.&nbsp; Cecil accordingly demolished the old grange and
erected a spacious and handsome mansion for her majesty&rsquo;s
reception.</p>
<p>A contemporary biographer of Cecil has pertinently observed,
&ldquo;He buylt three houses; one in London for necessity,
another at Burghley, of computency for the mansion of his Barony,
and another at Waltham for his younger sonne, which at the first
he meant but for a little pile, as I have hard him saie, but
after he came to enterteyne the Quene so often there he was
inforced to enlarge it, rather for the Quene and her greate
traine and to sette poore on worke, than for pompe or glory, for
he ever said it wold be to big for the smalle living he cold
leave his sonne.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same author also says Cecil
&ldquo;greatlie delighted in making gardens, fountaines, and
walkes, which at Theobalds were perfected most costly, bewtyfully
and pleasauntly, while one might walk twoe myle in the walkes
before he came to their ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norden has remarked of Cecil&rsquo;s new house: &ldquo;To
speake of the state and beauty thereof at large as it deserveth
for curious Buildings, delightfull walkes and pleasaunt conceits
within and without and other Thinges very glorious and elegant to
be seene, would challenge a great portion of this little
treatise, and therefore leaste I should come short of that one
commendation that it deserveth, I leave it as indeede it is, a
princely seate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vallens, in his &ldquo;Tale of Two Swannes&rdquo; (1590) also
pays a graceful tribute to Cecil and old Theobalds in the
following lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now see these Swannes, the new and worthy
seate<br />
Of famous Cecil, tresorer of the land,<br />
Whose wisdome, counsell, skill of princes&rsquo; state<br />
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>The world
admires; then Swannes may do the same:<br />
The house it selfe doth shewe the owner&rsquo;s wit,<br />
And may for beautie, state and every thing,<br />
Compared be with most within the land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>James I. and Theobalds.</h4>
<p>Lord Burleigh was succeeded in 1598 by his second son, Robert,
first Earl of Salisbury, who here entertained James I. for four
days on his way from Scotland to London to take possession of the
throne, as well as the Lords of the Council, who were here to do
homage to the son of Mary, Queen of Scots.&nbsp; In July, 1606,
James again visited the earl at Theobalds, together with the King
of Denmark, and their majesties were entertained with great
magnificence during a stay of five days.&nbsp; The account of the
proceedings related by a contemporary chronicler furnishes us
with an interesting if not very edifying glimpse into the ways
and manners of Court life in the seventeenth century.&nbsp; Much
of the period of their majesties&rsquo; stay at Theobalds appears
to have been occupied by a series of masques and debauches.&nbsp;
At one of the pageants the King of Denmark represented Solomon,
and a lady of the Court, in the character of the Queen of Sheba,
proceeded to perform her part by laying gifts at the
monarch&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; She had, however, imbibed so freely
of the fine wines supplied from the Cecil cellar that she was
unable to retain her balance, and fell, sprawling, into the lap
of the king.&nbsp; Rising from his magnificent throne, the latter
attempted to dance with the &ldquo;fallen&rdquo; queen, but the
royal legs being as unsteady as those of the lady, the twain cut
a sorry sight, and his majesty had to be carried away
ignominiously to his chamber.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now did appear,&rdquo;
writes the chronicler, who would seem to have been one of the
guests, &ldquo;Faith, Hope, and Charity.&nbsp; Hope did essay to
speak, but wine did render her endeavours so feeble that she
withdrew.&nbsp; Faith was then all alone, for I am certain she
was not joined by Good Works, and left the Court in a staggering
condition.&nbsp; Charity came then to the king&rsquo;s feet, and
soon returned to Hope and Faith, who were both sick in the lower
hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>So
delighted was King Jamie with Theobalds and the hunting afforded
by its domain, as well as in the adjoining Enfield Chase and
Waltham Forest, that he prevailed upon the noble owner to
exchange it for Hatfield, and the latter has since that time
(1608) remained the home of the Cecils.&nbsp; The king enlarged
the park of Theobalds, which he enclosed with a wall ten miles in
circumference.&nbsp; He passed nearly all his leisure here, and
died at Theobalds on March 25, 1625.</p>
<p>Charles I. also received homage at Theobalds upon his
succession to the throne, but he had not that affection for the
place which his father displayed.&nbsp; He retired hither,
however, at the end of 1641, or beginning of 1642, to escape the
unpleasantness of State affairs, and in February of the latter
year here received the solemn remonstrance of Parliament.&nbsp;
Hence he set out a month later, with a body of adherents, to
raise the Royal Standard at Nottingham.&nbsp; It is by some
stated that the unfortunate king wrote a portion of the
&ldquo;Eikon Basilike&rdquo; at Theobalds.</p>
<p>That strange passion for destruction which possessed Cromwell
and the Parliamentarians moved these ignorant sectarians to
destroy the handsome palace reared by Lord Burleigh, and enlarged
and beautified by James I.; its rich contents were dispersed, and
its beautiful gardens ruthlessly destroyed.</p>
<p>Charles II. bestowed the manor of Theobalds upon General
Monk&mdash;for the consideration of &pound;12,067 6s.
8d.&mdash;and created him Duke of Albemarle.&nbsp; It descended
to the Duke of Montagu, and later to the Cromwell family, then
with the estate of Cheshunt Park to the Russells, subsequently
became the property of Sir George Prescott, and finally was
purchased by the late Sir Henry Meux, Bart.&nbsp; In 1712, when
Sir Thomas Abney lived at Theobalds, he persuaded Dr. Isaac Watts
to retire hither.&nbsp; During his thirty-six years&rsquo;
residence here the learned divine wrote his famous hymns and
songs, and died in 1748 at the age of seventy-four.</p>

CHESHUNT AND ITS SURROUNDINGS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Old</span> Cheshunt village is a little
less than a mile north of Theobalds by the road that turns up the
hill, opposite Temple Bar, to Bury Green, thence leaving the
cemetery on the left.&nbsp; A pleasant old-fashioned inn, where
the magisterial business was dispensed for many years, and a
small cluster of houses form the old village to-day, with
Cheshunt College, a foundation by Selina Countess of Huntingdon,
for the training of Nonconformist ministers, hard by, and the
fine old parish church reposing in its ample &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
Acre,&rdquo; opposite.&nbsp; But in quite recent times the
builder has been busy in this locality, and at the bottom of the
village a good many houses of the suburban villa type have been
erected.&nbsp; The most populous part of Cheshunt has grown up
along either side of the high road, here known as Cheshunt
Street, nearly half a mile distant, eastward, leaving the old
village isolated, as it were.&nbsp; But it was here that stood
the fine old mansions for which the parish was once famed,
grouped around and about the church.&nbsp; Of these more
presently.&nbsp; Meantime a walk may profitably be taken along
Church Gate, whence proceeding between some handsome old
sixteenth century houses, with overhanging fronts, one steps into
a street or lane that wears a most charming air of
antiquity.&nbsp; At the bottom is the old Free school, founded by
Robert Dewhurst in 1640, the building forming an interesting
example of the domestic Tudor-Jacobean transition style.</p>
<h4>A strange Custom.</h4>
<p>Cheshunt is the modernised form of the Roman Cestrehunt.&nbsp;
A British encampment is said to have existed here, a little to
the west of the ancient Ermine Street, upon the track of which
the high road now runs.&nbsp; What may <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>be the remains of this exist in a
field lying on the west of the churchyard and close to the
cemetery.&nbsp; It is also recorded that a bank or earthen wall
extended in early times through this parish, which is believed to
have been the boundary of the East Saxons.&nbsp; In connection
with this bank a curious custom exists.&nbsp; By this, if a
copyholder dies seised of land on the west, or above bank, the
right of succession falls to the eldest son, but if it is below
the bank then to the youngest son.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=
"In the village at Cheshunt"

"In the village at Cheshunt"
 src="images/p45s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Cheshunt parish is an extensive one, and its physical aspect
wonderfully varied, with a richly wooded undulating
surface.&nbsp; There are many elevated situations from 300 to 354
feet above sea-level, and from most of these beautiful views of
the surrounding country are to be enjoyed.&nbsp; The district,
too, abounds in charming walks, and field paths are
numerous.&nbsp; Large areas are devoted to fruit culture, roses,
horticultural nurseries, and market gardens.&nbsp; Quite a
feature of the place are the extensive rose nurseries of Messrs.
Paul and Son in the high road, and these are well worthy a visit
by lovers of flowers, to whom they are at all times
accessible.</p>
<p>It was to old Pengelly House, which stood in its spacious
grounds (now built over), opposite Cheshunt College, that Richard
Cromwell, the deposed Protector, retired after his return from
the Continent in 1680.&nbsp; He spent his remaining days here as
the guest of Sergeant Pengelly, afterwards Chief Baron of the
Exchequer, in the name of Clarke.</p>
<h4>Cheshunt Great House.</h4>
<p>A little beyond the old village, on the road that runs to
Goff&rsquo;s Oak and Cheshunt Common&mdash;a beautiful breezy
height&mdash;stands a structure that strikes one as odd in form
and character.&nbsp; It is isolated and alone, occupying a slight
elevation, and little conjecture is needed to recognise this as
the remains of an old moated mansion.&nbsp; It is known as the
Great House, and believed to have originally been the Palace of
Waltham, of which ancient records speak, and later served as the
seat of the lord of the manor of St. Andrews-le-Motte.&nbsp; The
foundations <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>of this structure are by some authorities considered to
date back to the fifteenth century, and a well-known local
antiquary asserts that it was built 1380&ndash;90, as the palace
for Cardinal Henry Beaufort, second son of John of Gaunt.&nbsp;
The original house was a quadrangular Gothic building, surrounded
by a moat, of which traces are clearly discernible.&nbsp; A
considerable portion of the structure was demolished in
1801.&nbsp; The Great House long formed a dower palace of the
queens of England, and in 1519 was granted to Cardinal
Wolsey.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p46b.jpg">
<img alt=

 src="images/p46s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Though it is difficult to be precise and certain about the
history of this interesting old building, there can be no doubt
about its being a very old foundation, and having formed part of
a large and important domestic structure.&nbsp; The great hall,
which is the chief feature of the remains, is a very noble
apartment, and must belong to a period earlier than the
Tudors.&nbsp; It is 27 feet long by 21 feet wide, with a height
of 36 feet to the centre of the arched roof.&nbsp; This is
supported by ribs of chestnut wrought in the Gothic style.&nbsp;
The sides are wainscoted, and the floor is paved with black and
white marble.&nbsp; On the walls hang numerous portraits of kings
and queens, statesmen, and others, most of them attributed to
great masters.&nbsp; All I should like to say about them is that
as portraits many are interesting.&nbsp; There are also some
examples of chain and other armour and various weapons of war, as
well as some curious pieces of furniture, said to have belonged
to the mighty Cardinal.&nbsp; Several other apartments are open
to visitors, and in one is a quaint rocking-horse reported to
have belonged to Charles I., who was, of course, frequently at
Theobalds in the days of his childhood.&nbsp; Grim and tragic
stories are told about the underground chambers of this old
place.</p>
<h4>Cheshunt Church.</h4>
<p>The handsome old parish church of St. Mary&rsquo;s, which is
seen from the Great House, pleasantly and serenely ensconced amid
rich arboreal surroundings, is reached by a path through the
fields opposite.&nbsp; Though its foundation dates back to a
period anterior to the Conquest, for the church then <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>existing was
presented to the canon of the priory of Fulgar, in Brittany, by
Constance, daughter of William of Normandy, the present church is
a building of the sixteenth century, in the early Perpendicular
or Transition style.&nbsp; It was erected by Nicholas Dixon,
Clerk of the Pipe Office and Baron of the Exchequer, who held the
Rectory, temp. Henry VI.&nbsp; Like many another parish church
this of Cheshunt has undergone numerous alterations and
additions, ill-planned restorations and barbaric effacements, but
the survival is a beautiful building, of noble proportions and of
no slight architectural interest.&nbsp; Perhaps its most
noticeable feature is the fine stone and flint embattled tower,
with an octagon cupola at the south-east corner.&nbsp; This
probably replaced the spire which originally graced the tower,
and from a date on the lead beneath would seem to have been
erected in 1811.&nbsp; From another angle formerly projected a
cresset, very similar to that on Hardley Church, near
Barnet.&nbsp; The precise use of these old beacon lights on
churches seems not to be very clear, but they were probably used
as signals of alarm in troublous times.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Few who enter this church by the handsome doorway at the base
of the tower, the armorial ornamentation of which is worthy
notice, will fail to admire the view which is afforded when
standing beneath the noble western arch of the lower wall, by the
handsome nave and chancel, lighted by a clerestory, and closed in
by an open timber roof, the latter beautifully painted.&nbsp;
There is a good deal to interest one within the church.&nbsp;
There will be noticed a modern Rood screen across the chancel
front, and originally there existed a very handsome screen of
this character, access to which was gained by a small staircase
on the southern side, which was clumsily demolished at the
restoration in 1872.&nbsp; In the chancel pavement is a brass to
Nicholas Dixon, the founder, whilst a Gothic altar tomb of
Purbeck marble occupies a recess in the north wall.&nbsp; The
latter is to the memory of Robert Dacres, of Cheshunt, Privy
Councillor to Henry VIII.&nbsp; Other notable monuments are those
of Sir Henry Atkins, physician to James I. <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>and Charles,
Daniel Dodson and Margaret Lady Whatton, whose virtues are thus
recited:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fair as an Angel, virtuous as a saint,<br
/>
Whose beauty and whose grace no art can paint,<br />
Highly belov&rsquo;d by all and so admir&rsquo;d,<br />
As much bewail&rsquo;d when she from hence retir&rsquo;d,<br />
Her soul so pure from earth to Heaven soar&rsquo;d,<br />
There to enjoy the God she here enjoy&rsquo;d,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the nave and chancel on either side is a curious
ornamental opening pierced through the wall.&nbsp; What purpose
these served it is hard to determine.&nbsp; In the tower chamber,
which has a beautiful vaulted roof, is the ancient octagonal font
of Purbeck marble, as well as the very old alms chest or poor
man&rsquo;s box, with three fine hasps and locks, and strongly
bonded with iron.&nbsp; In the churchyard stand a large square
tomb, the burial place of the Cromwell family for several
generations.</p>
<p>The Cromwells held Cheshunt Park, which lies a little less
than a mile north of the church, beyond Flamstead End.&nbsp; This
pleasant little hamlet would seem by its name to furnish another
link with Saxon times, for Flamstead in Anglo-Saxon would mean
&ldquo;place of refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manor of Cheshunt Park originally belonged to the Crown,
but was purchased by Sir William Cecil in 1570, and became merged
in the manor of Theobalds.&nbsp; It was seized with other Crown
lands by the Parliament in 1650, and then leased to William
Groff.&nbsp; Thence it passed to the Cromwells and
Russells.&nbsp; Mrs. Russell was the last person who bore at
birth the name of Cromwell, through direct male descent.&nbsp;
Her father, Oliver, great-grandson of Henry, son of the
Protector, was very desirous of leaving his name to his
son-in-law, and applied several times for the royal licence for
Mr. Russell to assume it.&nbsp; But the king, George III., always
refused, saying, &ldquo;No! no!&nbsp; No more Oliver
Cromwells!&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a plan of the park made in
connection with a survey in 1611, in the British Museum, and it
is therein stated to be &ldquo;in length just 3 myles and in
circuit along the paile 8 myle lack 30 poles.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>At the
northern extremity of the parish, along the high road, lies the
hamlet of Turnford, still a picturesque little spot, though now
given over to the builder and market gardener.&nbsp; Scores of
acres of glasshouses exist here.&nbsp; In early times, however,
the famous nunnery of the Benedictines extended along the eastern
side of the road here.&nbsp; At the Dissolution this, with other
lands in the parish, fell into the possession of that &ldquo;old
land grabber,&rdquo; as a Herts antiquary has dubbed Sir Anthony
Denny.&nbsp; Nothing now remains of the nunnery.</p>
<p>Cheshunt Street contains a good many interesting examples of
old domestic architecture.&nbsp; There is rather a curious
structure here known locally as the Round House, which has been
in the family of the present owner since the time of
Elizabeth.&nbsp; It was built by a descendant of one of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s sea captains, who was engaged in the seven
years&rsquo; war.&nbsp; He settled down here, and called it
Effingham Place.</p>
<h4>The heights of Cheshunt</h4>
<p>The highlands of Cheshunt are all of a beautiful character,
and the climate of these elevated situations is particularly
healthful, the air being clear and bracing.&nbsp; To the north
lie Hammond Street, Appleby Street, and the beautiful sylvan
hamlet of Beaumont Manor; to the west is the pleasant old village
of Goff&rsquo;s Oak, with pretty Newgate Street beyond, and the
noble domain of Wood Green Park adjacent.&nbsp; More to the north
is the picturesque old hamlet of Cuffley, to the curative waters
of whose well King James frequently repaired.&nbsp; From Cuffley
one may enjoy a very fine view of the Lea Valley and the richly
timbered undulations of Epping Forest.&nbsp; The little place is
effectually cut off from the affairs of ordinary civilisation,
and is as isolated as a hamlet in the heart of Warwickshire.</p>
<p>Goff&rsquo;s Oak is a pretty little place, with many
interesting features about it.&nbsp; Its numerous
cottages&mdash;there is only one good-sized house&mdash;lie,
irregularly disposed on either side of the road, often behind
ample gardens beautiful with lilies and larkspur, rocket,
wallflowers, hollyhocks, and other old-time flowers.&nbsp; It
gains its <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>name from a famous old oak tree, said to have been
planted by one of William the Conqueror&rsquo;s heroes, Sir
Theodore Godfrey, to whom lands here had been assigned (hence
Godfrey&rsquo;s&mdash;Geoffrey&rsquo;s
Oak&mdash;Geoff&rsquo;s&mdash;Goff&rsquo;s Oak).&nbsp; The
venerable tree, of which only the trunk now remains, has a girth
of over twenty feet at three feet from the ground.&nbsp; It
reminds one of the beautiful lines of Dryden:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Monarch Oak, the Patriarch of the
Trees,<br />
Shoots rising up, and spreads by slow degrees;<br />
Three centuries he grows, and three he stays,<br />
Supreme in state; and in three more decays.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<b><i>LL.D.</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><b>With numerous Illustrations,
Maps and Diagrams</b>.</p>
<p><b>THE HOMELAND READERS</b>, for Council and all Public and
Private Schools, are issued by the Homeland Association, which is
doing so much to encourage Touring at Home in the Motherland of
our Empire, and in widening our knowledge of Great Britain, by
publishing a series of Handbooks containing useful and
interesting information relating to towns and country districts
in various parts of the land.&nbsp; This &ldquo;national and
patriotic work&rdquo; has not only received the commendation of
the King, but his Majesty has authorised a copy of each volume
issued by the Association to be sent to him.</p>
<p><b>THE HOMELAND READERS</b>, like the Homeland Hand-books,
contain a description of the most striking Geographical and
Natural features, with particulars of the History, Traditions,
Antiquities, Worthies, and Industries of each County.&nbsp; The
treatment of the subject is very simple and, as far as possible,
all difficulties are explained as they occur.&nbsp; The First, or
Junior Book, for children under 10 years of age, contains but few
place-names.&nbsp; Only the chief features and events are given,
with sufficient details to awaken interest and impart life and
colour.&nbsp; The Second, or Senior Book, for older children, is
as comprehensive and exhaustive as the space will allow.</p>

<b>Telegraphic Address: Nicholas, Undertaker, Cheshunt.</b></p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Of the many classes of business called into requisition by the
requirements of mundane existence, that of the Funeral Furnisher
demands an interest which it is seldom accorded.&nbsp; This is,
however, not the correct position to adopt in what is an
eminently practical age, so, at least, we are taught to believe;
and, therefore, we should not disdain knowledge on so important a
subject.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the district of <b>Cheshunt</b> no name is more intimately
associated with <b>funeral furnishing</b> than that of <b>Mr. A.
G. Nicholas</b>, and no house has made a more thorough study of
the details of the business so as to entail upon the relatives
and friends of the deceased the <b>minimum amount of trouble and
discomfort</b>.&nbsp; Over twenty years ago witnessed his initial
steps in founding what is now the only business which makes a
speciality of this class of work, as the premises recently
constructed <b>at 189</b>, <b>Turner&rsquo;s Hill</b> make
sufficiently plain to the passer-by.&nbsp; Commencing business as
a joiner, builder, and undertaker at the period mentioned, the
marked development of the latter department&mdash;as witness the
many interments of deceased persons&mdash;has induced <b>Mr.
Nicholas</b> to give special attention to this branch, which
includes <b>cremating and embalming</b>, the erecting of all
descriptions of <b>monumental masonry</b>, surveys of property,
and transactions in all forms of life and other insurance,
agencies being held for many leading companies.</p>
<p>When we consider the opportunity which the undertaker
possesses for exercising influence upon persons under great
mental strain, it will be seen how essential it is that they
should be men who are above suspicion.&nbsp; Happily, however,
the morale of the business has greatly improved, which is due in
a large measure to the standard of the tradesmen who may be said
to be representative of their calling.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Cromwell Cottages, Cheshunt, June
5th, 1891.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Nicholas.&mdash;On behalf of myself and the rest of
our family, I wish to thank you for the way in which you
conducted the funeral of my mother and brother.&nbsp; I am sure
you studied our feelings in every possible way, and we all think
the charges very moderate indeed.&nbsp; Again thanking
you,&mdash;I remain, yours truly,</p>

interment was conducted,&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Wimbledon, April 1st, 1904.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Nicholas,&mdash;I feel that I must write to thank you
for your great kindness to us in our trouble, and for the kind
help you gave to save us bother in every possible way you
could.&nbsp; I cannot express to you all I feel about it; but,
believe me, my sisters and I will never forget your kindness to
us; and if there were just a few more about as ready as yourself
to lend a helping hand, the world might be a happier
one.&mdash;With very kind regards, I am yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Nicholas,&mdash;I had not an opportunity of seeing
you yesterday, to thank you for undertaking the removal of the
body of my poor brother, and for the great trouble it must have
put you to.&nbsp; I can assure you that you have all our sincere
thanks, and we quite appreciate all the difficulties you must
have had to contend with.&nbsp; Now he is at rest, we can also
rest.&nbsp; You will, I am sure, know how we can and do
appreciate this after such an anxious and trying time as last
week.&nbsp; We could not do this but for the trouble you must
have taken for us.&mdash;Yours very truly,</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholas.&nbsp; Dear Sir,&mdash;I beg to offer my sincere
thanks for the trouble you have taken in connection with the
interment of my deceased father on the 27th inst., for the nice
way in which your arrangements were made and carried out in so
quiet and sympathetic a manner that all the mourners thought you
had conducted the funeral in such a way that the thanks of the
family were justly due to you.&nbsp; I hope you will accept these
through me, the son of the late Henry Brewster.</p>

must thank you and express my appreciation of the able and
reverent manner in which the funeral arrangements were carried
out, and with kind regards, I remain yours faithfully,</p>

<p>The local &ldquo;Weekly Telegraph,&rdquo; reporting the
funeral of the late Mr. R. T. Gardner, in 1899, who was for
twenty-five years rate collector of the Parish of Cheshunt,
mentioned the fact that the arrangements were undertaken by Mr.
Nicholas, at the request of the deceased, made shortly before his
death.</p>

Gas or Oil Lamps?</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">N.B.&mdash;There were <b>142</b>
Explosions by Oil Lamps in<br />
London alone last year, involving loss of life.</p>
<p>An OIL LAMP burns ONE PENNYWORTH OF PARAFFIN OIL in 8 hours,
and gives a light equal to only 16 Candles.&nbsp; It is much
dearer than a GEM GAS BURNER, which makes ONE PENNYWORTH OF
AUTOMATIC GAS last about 12 hours, and gives a light equal to 30
Candles.&nbsp; In fact a Gem Burner is nearly equal to 4 Oil
Lamps.&nbsp; That is to say, a Gem Burner will give you about as
much light for a Farthing as an Oil Lamp will give for a 1d.</p>
<p>AUTOMATIC GAS costs you nothing for fitting it up.&nbsp; The
Gas Company instal it free of all cost.&nbsp; The following
fittings are supplied free for your use:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">One Swing Bracket for Hall Light.</p>
<p class="gutindent">One Pendant or Bracket for Sitting Room.</p>
<p class="gutindent">One ,, ,, Kitchen.</p>
<p class="gutindent">One Swing Bracket for Bedroom.</p>
<p class="gutindent">One Boiling Ring and Tube to boil Kettle,
etc.</p>
<p>By payment of <b>5s.</b> for fixing you can have a good Gas
Cooker Free of any Rental, or a better one for 10d. a month.</p>
<p><b>Remember Automatic Gas</b> saves a lot of worry and trouble
in the house.&nbsp; Half-an-hour&rsquo;s more rest instead of
getting up earlier to light the fire.&nbsp; The Oil Man need not
call.&nbsp; No dust or ashes, and no Dustman to call for
them.&nbsp; The Coal Man need not call.&nbsp; No bundles of
firewood wanted.&nbsp; You simply put your penny in the slot and
the Gasworks does the rest.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
